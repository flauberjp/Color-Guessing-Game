# Color-Guessing-Game
Javascript game where the player need to guess what is the right color using the
minimum amount of guesses possible.

Logic:
1) List a set of color, sorted alphabetically;
2) You think of one, keep it secret.
2) Ask the player to guess which color you are thinking of. Keep counting the  
number of guesses.
3) If the guess color is not the right one, check if it is alphabetically  
higher or lower than it, then tell the user, asking him to do another guess;
4) If the color is the right one, set it as the background color, and
congratulate the player, also listing how many guesses he tried.
